	Nearby floating objects mutually attract through capillary interactions in a shape-dependent mechanism. 
	
	These capillary interactions, commonly known as the Cheerios effect, is a gravity and surface-wetting driven process communicated along the interface. This attraction has been observed or postulated in locomotion of aquatic plant seeds\cite{peruzzo2013capillary}, meniscus climbing insects\cite{hu2005meniscus} and directed colloidal self-assembly\cite{fan2004assembly}. Thus far, studies have extensively focused on either smooth objects//cite//, objects spaced far apart//cite// or on objects on an initially curved interface//cite//. There

	//Objects may become non-planar//
	
	
	Figure 1 presents qualitative observations of the attraction between two floating 1'' wide acrylic triangles as they approach each other, viewed from above. For a large class of relative initial positions and orientations, they rotate such that corners kiss first, after which they will fold or slide into a more stable final configuration. Prior to kissing, it appears that attraction is localized at the corners where there is a curvature singularity //cite//. To the best of our knowledge, the force of attraction between sharp objects of comparable sizes have never been quantified before
	
	and that the attractive behavior of sharp objects is different from smooth objects. The force of attraction due to corners have never been quantified before. In this letter, we show that the attraction scales as $d^{14/5}$, where $d$ is the distance between 60 $^{\circ} $ corners. 
	
	The process described above depends entirely on the shape of the meniscus around each object. We calculate using
