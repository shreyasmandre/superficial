\section{Introduction}
	
	Thin floating objects mutually attract through capillary interactions in a shape-dependent mechanism. These capillary interactions, commonly known as the “Cheerios Effect”, is a gravity and surface wetting driven process communicated along the interface on which these object float.  This attractive mechanism has been observed or postulated in locomotion of aquatic plant seeds\cite{peruzzo2013capillary}, directed colloidal self-assembly\cite{fan2004assembly}, .... Thus far, studies has been focused on smooth objects and there is relatively less attention on objects with sharp corners, which we refer to as sharp objects. 
	
	In general, sharp objects behave differently from smooth objects because the corners pins the local interface or contact line onto a discontinuity. Figure 1 presents qualitative observation of the attraction of two floating 1'' wide acrylic triangles as they approach each other, viewed from above. For a large class of relative initial position and orientation of the triangles, they rotate such that corners kiss first, after which they will fold or slide into a more stable final configuration. Prior to kissing, it appears that attraction is localized at the corners due to the curvature singularity  the contact line. The force of attraction between corners has never been quantified before. In this letter, we show that the attraction scales as $d^{-14/5}$, where $d$ is the distance between 60$^{\circ}$ corners. % which extends further than an exponential.

\section{Methods}
//Explanation of measuring surface gradients to calculate force - explain the equation to calculate force//

We calculate the attractive force between two floating objects by measuring the surface gradients of the deformed interface ... DIC

\begin{equation}
F_h \approx \frac{\sigma}{2} \int _C [\frac{u^2}{l_c^2}- u_n^2 +u_t^2] dt
\end{equation}

Figure 2 shows that calculated force between two 1/16" thick acrylic circles as a function of distance.

//As a check, show attractive force between spheres and compare with literature//

Force from deformation of meniscus. Measure Meniscus deformations - Verify using circles. Use for triangles for d ~ lc and $d << lc$.

\section{Results}
//Show derivation for conformal mapping on angles//

//Show ux scaling for the inner and outer region//

//Show Force plot and regions of scaling//

\section{Discussion}
What does this mean?

Force concentrated at vertices is much stronger than force between smooth edges.
