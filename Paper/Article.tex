\section{Introduction}
Spheres and cylinders have been studied but not corners? Why are we studying corners? Corners exhibit singularities and therefore possibly have different behaviors. Quadrupoles are used to explain, but we present an alternative perspective.

Insert figure on qualitative experiments showing rotating triangles.
Insert some applications for motivation.

\section{Methods}
Force from deformation of meniscus. Measure Meniscus deformations - Verify using circles. Use for triangles for d ~ lc and d << lc.

\section{Results}
How to understand forces? Conformal Mapping.

\section{Discussion}
What does this mean?

Force concentrated at vertices is much stronger than force between smooth edges.

\section{Figures}

Figure 3: Power law scaling and force vs. distances.
